		practicing in code is the best way to get there.<br />

<button class="accordion">What's the best way to learn programming?</button>
<div class="panel">
	<span>
		The best way by far to learn this material is by actually coding. Whenever you are given a new 
		concept you should try it out in code, even if there's no assignment for it.  
		Writing many small programs, experimenting, and researching on the Internet are the best ways to 
		master programming.  Contact me if you're looking for ideas about practice programs.
