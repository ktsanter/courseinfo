<button class="ci-accordion">What is the policy on late work?</button>
<div class="ci-panel">
	<span>
		This is an AP course so strict deadlines are in place for your assignments. 
		However, I want to encourage each of you to finish your work and have a chance to 
		learn from your mistakes even when things go wrong. My policy on late work is:

		<ul>
			<li>All assignments except for exams may be revised and resubmitted up to the due date with no penalty.  
				At my discretion there may be a limit on the number of resubmissions for some assignments.
			</li>
			<li>Students receive a 20% reduction on the earned score for a late assignment, including tests and quizzes, 
				turned in within one week of the due date.
			</li>
			<li>Students receive a 40% reduction on the earned score for a late assignment, including tests and quizzes, 
				turned in within two weeks of the due date.
			</li>
			<li>Work submitted more than two weeks late will be reviewed but given a 0.</li>
			<li>In extenuating circumstances, a student must work directly with the instructor and mentor to 
				develop and request reasonable alternative due dates on particular assignments/tests, in order 
				to avoid a score reduction in assignment or exam grades.
			</li>
		</ul>

		Please contact me any time you have questions about due dates or revising assignments.<br />
		As you get started in the term I will be a little more relaxed on the deadlines, but bear in 
		mind that time management is a key skill for success in this course.

<button class="ci-accordion">What is the policy on passwords and proctoring?</button>
<div class="ci-panel">
	<span>
		There are important policies to follow for exams in an Advanced Placement course like this:
		<ul>
			<li>All tests and exams have passwords.  Please ask your mentor to enter the password.  
			    For security reasons students should not handle any passwords
			</li>
			<li>All tests and exams must be proctored.  This means your mentor must supervise as you 
			    take the test.  Bear in mind this means you should schedule your exams with your mentor 
				well ahead of the due date.
			</li>
			<li>Exams, tests, and quizzes cannot be retaken.</li>
		</ul>
		
		Please let me know if you have questions or concerns about these policies.
