<button class="accordion">What's the best way to learn programming?</button>
<div class="panel">
	<span>
		The best way by far to learn this material is by actually coding. Whenever you are given a 
		new concept you should try it out in code, even if there's no assignment for it.  
		Writing many small programs, experimenting, and researching on the Internet are the best ways 
		to master programming.  Contact me if you're looking for ideas about practice programs.
