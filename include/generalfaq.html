<div class="panel">
	You have a lot of options for contacting me and I'm 
	always open to suggestions for other methods.  
	I look forward to hearing from you!

	<ul>
		<li><strong>SLP message</strong>:  The Messaging tab in the SLP is basically an email system.  My address there is "Santer, Kevin (TEACHER)" </li>
		<li><strong>voice/text</strong>:   Call me at 734.999.0587.  This is a Google Voice number I have set up just for students</li>
		<li><strong>email</strong>:  you can reach me at ksanter.michiganvirtual.org</li>
		<li><strong>office hours</strong>:  I use a tool called Blackboard Collaborate to hold "live" office hours, typically twice a week.  
		    We can also make an appointment if the times don't suit you.  Click on the Live Chat option in the navigation bar to check it out.
			If there's another communication tool you'd like to use (Skype, Google Hangouts, etc.) just let me know.
